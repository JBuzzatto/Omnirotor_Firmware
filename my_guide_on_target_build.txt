##important files:

Firmware/boards/px4/sitl/default.cmake
	- on here you must include the modules and drivers you want to build
	- it also specify apps and commands to be loaded/build for the board

Firmware/platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake
	- on here you add your gazebo model as a target as well


##For the real hardware, Pixhawk 1 in our case, the hardware is in accordance with fmu-v2.
The make command would be, for standard:
	make px4_fmu-v2_default

However, you can just create your own .cmake file, as it is done for the examples multicopter.cmake and fixedwing.cmake files
already in the Firmware/boards/px4/fmu-v2/ folder.
