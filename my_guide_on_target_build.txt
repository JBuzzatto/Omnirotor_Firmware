##important files:

Firmware/boards/px4/sitl/default.cmake
	- on here you must include the modules and drivers you want to build
	- it also specify apps and commands to be loaded/build for the board

Firmware/platforms/posix/cmake/sitl_target.cmake
	- on here you add your gazebo model as a target as well


##For the real hardware, Pixhawk 1 in our case, the hardware is in accordance with fmu-v2.
The make command would be, for standard:
	make px4_fmu-v2_default

However, you can just create your own .cmake file, as it is done for the examples multicopter.cmake and fixedwing.cmake files
already in the Firmware/boards/px4/fmu-v2/ folder.

- If you want to change parameters, it is best to change on other files other than on the airframe definition file.
For changes on the airframe file to take place, you have to upload the firmware via QGroundControl, and re-select your airframe in the menu. This is bad
because you will have to re-calibrate the sensors.
	- This is true for mixer too, apparently


- For the mixer to change, you have to upload the firmware via QGroundControl?
